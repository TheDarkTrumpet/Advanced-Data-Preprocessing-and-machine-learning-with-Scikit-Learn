# Advanced-Data-Preprocessing-and-machine-learning-with-Scikit-Learn

## Purpose/Reason

The original upload from Orange was incorrect.  They didn't upload the git-lfs artifacts, only the pointers, which caused the repository's lfs objects to not work.  The original author, has the repository up but I wanted to also clean up some of the artifacts left behind in his commit too.

This repository aims to clean up, but retain, the things that were missed.
